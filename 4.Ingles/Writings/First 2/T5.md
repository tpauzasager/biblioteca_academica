Many parents often complains about her children spending too much time in front of a screen. "They are unable to entertain themselves without technology", they say. There is no need for research in order to come to the conclusion that the use of technology in the entertainment industry has increase drastically and children seem to be the most affected ones in this situation. Many suggest this is cause by the grate availability of this gadgets. Where many year ago, there were very few screens on the hose, now a days, there is one screen for every person in the hose, at least. 
What is more concerning is the attitude children have towards book and reading in general. In the past, books where a fundamental tool for entertainment but now, children regards them to only studying purposes. 
In my believe, parents are the only ones who can revert this situation. The first years of life in any children is crucial to develop their personality, so parent should get involved and show them the benefits of having good and healthy habits.
