Everyone likes to watch the TV from time to time, and i am not different. Here i am today to tell you about one of my favorite series, The Avatar: The legend of Ang. The plot is set on a world separated into four main nations and each of them correspond to a specific element: Air, Water, Earth and Fire. Most of the people in these nations know how to bend their element, this meaning that they can control the specific element depending on the nation they are born. 
The main character is Ang, the Avatar of that era, whose purpose is to free the world from the war started by the Fire nation many years before. In order to achieve this goal, he needs to improve his skills and starts a journey around the world, learning new skills, meeting new people and making friends on every place he goes. 
Even though this series is targeted towards children, I believe that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. This is thanks to the amazing story telling and character development accomplished by the directors of this terrific series.
